\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present a Salient Region conducted Local Feature algorithm. Instead of computing directly on local image features, {\sys} takes advantage of an approximate salient region detection approach to perform local feature reduction. According to our evaluation, {\sys} can help to improves the performance of SURF descriptor with a 1.6X speedup and can be combined with all kinds of {\lfea}s . Furthermore, when used in a realistic image retrieval system, our algorithm improve the query performance more than 2 times.
